# Welcome to my Terraform Repository
This repository contains a collection of projects and hands-on exercises that I have worked on to gain expertise in Terraform. I have used Terraform to provision, manage, and automate cloud infrastructure and resources across various cloud providers, including Azure and AWS. I have experience working with various Terraform components, including providers, modules, variables, and outputs.
